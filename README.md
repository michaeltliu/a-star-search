## a-star-search
Visualize the A* search algorithm performed on randomly generated terrain

Requires pygame. Install using `pip install pygame`

Run program in command line: `python3 game.py`

Static weighting of the heuristic is adjustable at the top of the code, as well as grid size and animation speed

Apparently Euclidean distance being a consistent heuristic doesn't allow me to forgo a minimum path length map for visited nodes. Go figure
